    "There is a clever algorithm for computing the Fibonacci numbers in a logarithmic number of steps. Recall the transformation of the state variables `a` and `b` in the `fib-iter` process of section 1.2.2: $a \\gets a + b$ and $b \\gets a$. Call this transformation $T$, and observe that applying $T$ over and over again $n$ times, starting with $1$ and $0$, produces the pair $Fib(n+1)$ and $Fib(n)$. In other words, the Fibonacci numbers are produced by applying $T^n$, the nth power of the transformation $T$, starting with the pair $(1,0)$. Now consider $T$ to be the special case of $p = 0$ and $q = 1$ in a family of transformations $T_{pq}$, where $T_{pq}$ transforms the pair $(a,b)$ according to a $\\gets bq + aq + ap$ and $b \\gets bp + aq$. Show that if we apply such a transformation $T_{pq}$ twice, the effect is the same as using a single transformation $T_{p^{\\prime}q^\\prime}$ of the same form, and compute $p^\\prime$ and $q^\\prime$ in terms of $p$ and $q$. This gives us an explicit way to square these transformations, and thus we can compute $T^n$ using successive squaring, as in the `fast-expt` procedure.
